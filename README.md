# **file-upload**
This is a small project that will use Express with React Hooks to build a simple file upload app. This is to test out an idea that I might incorporate into a larger project in the future.

## To Do:
 - [x] Move `"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"` outside of `browserslist` object in /client/package.json.
